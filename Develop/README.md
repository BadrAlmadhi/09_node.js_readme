# Readme file generator 

## Description
The project is a README file generator. Many new users struggle to create a GitHub README. In addition, we all know how important it is to create a README file to explain the ideas of the app. This project will help users generate a file without worrying about syntax. This generator will help people create a README by answering a series of questions to complete the file base on their answers. After that, users will have a professional README file that will attract users to use their app by providing the information needed for the application. 

- What was your motivation?
<br>
My motivation is to make README a simple task for new users. My first time using GitHub, I struggled with the README file. I was always wondering when making my README to make it look professional. After reading the Request-Response, the full-stack blog to create a professional README guide. I learned how to make a high-quality README by explaining what the application does and why you used the technologies for the app. With this information, I can describe the project by following the what, why, and how of the project.

- Why did you build this project?
<br>
When learning about node.js, I learned about npm and packages that help build the back end of an application. One of the main things I learned is generating a file using fs.writeFile and node.js libraries for tuning web applications. This project helped me understand using inquirer and generating markdown using an fs key to generate README file in a much simpler task for new users.

I have learned a lot about back-end development when building this project. One of the main things is using node.js and its libraries. Another thing I learned is the arrow function and functions such as ".prompt( )" and ".then" to generate a file. Also, I learned about installing npm to test applications on multiple versions of npm. The version used for this project is 8.2.4. Another thing I learned is to install package-lock.json and node_modules to run the application. After that, I learned about running the node in the terminal to generate the file.
